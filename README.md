     - `example_detection.png` - An example of your model's detection/output
     - `example_PR_curve.png` - Your model's precision-recall curve

3. **Render the model card:**
   ```
   # For HTML output
   quarto render my_model_card.qmd --to html
   
   # For PDF output
   quarto render my_model_card.qmd --to pdf
   ```
   The output will be in the `_output` folder.
